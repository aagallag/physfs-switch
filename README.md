# PhysicsFS - Switch
A fork of PhysicsFS for the Switch (libnx).

## Version
Based on [PhysicsFS 3.0.1](https://icculus.org/physfs/downloads/physfs-3.0.1.tar.bz2).

## Compile Instructions
Assuming devkitPro and libnx are installed, just simply run `make` in the root directory.  Then, add this directory to `LIBDIRS` in your project's `Makefile`.

## WARNING
This is very buggy on the Switch.
